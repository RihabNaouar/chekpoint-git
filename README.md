It's a checkpoint linked to the git and github course where I used several git orders: 
- **cd**** : Navigate to the Desired Directory
- **mkdir**: Used to create directories (folders)
- **pwd**: To know your current location within the file system hierarchy
- **touch**: Used to create empty files
- **git init**: used to initialize a new Git repository in a directory.
It sets up all the necessary files and data structures required for Git to start tracking changes and managing versions of the project files
- **git add**: Used to stage changes for commit in a Git repository. It tells Git to include updates or new files in the next commi
- **ls -a**: Used to list all files and directories in a directory, including hidden files and directories
- **git commit**: Used to record the changes made to the files in a Git repositorY
- **git log**: Used to display the commit history of a Git repository. It shows a list of commits in reverse chronological order, meaning the most recent commits appear first
- **rm**: Used to remove files or directories in Unix-like operating systems
- **git config --global core.pager cat**: This command sets the pager to cat, which means Git will not paginate the output when it's longer than one screen. Instead, it will simply display the entire output at once
- **git config --list**: List all Git configurations, including both local (repository-specific) and global configurations.
- **git config --global**: This command is typically used to view or modify Git's global configuration settings
- **git branch -M main**: used to rename the current branch to "main"
- **git remote add origin**: Typically used to add a remote repository named "origin" to the local Git repository
- **git push -u origin main**: Used to push commits from your local repository to a remote repository
